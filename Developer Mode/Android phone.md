Did you know, there is a secret mode on Androids called <q>Developer Mode</q>?

The steps to do it:
- Go to <q>About phone</q>
- Go to <q>Software settings</q>
- Press the <q>Build number</q> **7** times

Then that's about it!
You can change your settings to be like mine, where it <ins>tracks your taps and drags, as well as tracking the coordinates on your phone for that</ins>!
