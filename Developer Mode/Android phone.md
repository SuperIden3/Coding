Did you know, there is a secret mode on Androids called <q>Developer Mode</q>?

The steps to do it:
- Go to <q>About phone</q>
- Go to <q>Software settings</q>
- Press the <q>Build number</q> **7** times

Then that's about it!
You can change your settings to be like mine, where it <ins>tracks your taps and drags, as well as tracking the coordinates on your phone for that</ins>!

There is also something that's about <q>USB connecting</q>. It's where you can connect a USB to another device to link that device, including the touching and dragging, to that other device. The other device can then track the drags and touches from the other device, if you use some-a that JS.
