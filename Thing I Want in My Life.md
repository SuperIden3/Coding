<dt><input type="checkbox" />Magnetic Thinking Putty</dt>
<dd>Magnetic thinking putty is like silly putty, but with lots of micro-magnetic particles in it. When put next to a [strong] magnet and wait for 30 minutes, the substance will be attracted  to it and cover it entirely.</dd>
<dt><input type="checkbox" />D30</dt>
<dd>D30 is a substance in which it softens when a soft force is applied, but hardens when a hard force is applied. Such substances are called “non-newtonian fluids.” D30 is made up of mulecules that move freely when under gentle pressure, but come together tightly on impact. It's a great shock-absorbing material.</dd>
